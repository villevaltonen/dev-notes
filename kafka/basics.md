## Basics

- A distributed pub/sub streaming platform
- Data within Kafka is called a message
    - An array of bytes
    - Optional metadata called key (also a byte arrays)
- Batch is a collection of messages, which are produced to the same topic and partition
- Topics are broken down into partitions
- Messages are being written by producers and read by consumers
- Connect and Streams are based on producers/consumers
- Messages can be directed to specific partitions with key
- Consumers are keeping track on read messages with offset
- Consumers are dividing partitions between a consumer group
- Kafka server is called broker and multiple brokers form a cluster
- Cluster has a controller, which is elected and is responsible of administrative operations
- Benefits of Kafka
    - Multiple producers
    - Multiple consumers
    - Scalability
    - High performance
    - Disk-based retention
