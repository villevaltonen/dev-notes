### Goroutines
- creating goroutines
    - use go-keyword in front of function call
    - when using anonymous functions, pass data as local variable
- synchronization
    - use sync.WaitGroup to wait for groups of goroutines to complete
    - use sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex to protect data access
- parallelism
    - by default, Go will use CPU threads equal to available cores
    - change with runtime.GOMAXPROCS
    - more threads can increase performance, but too many can slow it down
- best practices
    - don't create goroutines in libraries
        - let consumer control concurrency
    - when creating a goroutine, know how it will end
        - avoids subtle memory leaks
    - check for race conditions at compile time
