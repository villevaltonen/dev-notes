### Constants
- immutable, but can be shadowed
- replaced by the compiler at compile time
    - value must be calculable at compile time
- named like variables
- typed constant work like immutable variables
    - can interoperate only with same type
- untyped constants work like literals
    - can interoperate with similar types
- enumerated constants
    - special symbol "iota" allows related constants to be created easily
    - iota starts at 0 in each const block and increments by one
    - watch out of constant values that match zero values for variables
- enumerated expressions
    - operations that can be determined at compile time are allowed
        - arithmetic
        - bitwise operations
        - bitshifting
