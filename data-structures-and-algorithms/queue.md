## Queue (e.g. LinkedQueue)

- offer: add to the end of queue
- peek: returns the value of the first element
- poll: removes and returns the first element
- Two type of operations, others return a value and others throw an exception
- Java API recommends ArrayDeque

```java
Queue queue = new ArrayDeque() // Only operations of a queue are available
```
