## Graphs

- Multiple predecessors and successors
- Directed and bi-directed graphs
  - If the direction of predecessor/successor does not matter, bi-directed graph can be used
- Terminology
  - V is a set of nodes/vertices (vertex)
  - E is a set of edges in directed graph (from node to node)
  - Node can have n neighbours
  - Node can be a neighbour to itself
  - Path is a line of nodes in a directed graph
  - Ring is a path which returns to the first node
- Both nodes and edges can contain useful information
- Nodes and edges can be weighted (e.g. price, kilometres etc.)
- If needed, markings of handled nodes and edges can be used (usually referenced as colors)
- Graph is made of sets of nodes and edges
  - Modified set operations are used for handling them
  - Nodes are clearly a set
  - Edges are actually a relation
