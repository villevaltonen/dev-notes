## Relation and map

### Relation

- If elements of a set have special structure, the operations can be re-defined
- Relation is implemented like a set
- Set of tuples (set of objects)

### Map

- (a1, b1), (a2, b2)
  - a1 != a2, b1 == b2
- As an abstract data structure (Map M, K k, E X)
  - Map<K, E> Map<K, E>)()
- In an infinite map "set" is not reasonable (it is left out) and compute (get) is implemented with a function (by calculating)
- Time complexities O(logn) in a tree implementation, O(1) in a successful hash implementation
- Interface: java.util.Map
