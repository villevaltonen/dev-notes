## Basics

### Algorithm basics

- Algorithm is a peripheral sequence of actions
- Executable in a peripheral period of time
- Executable with a peripheral amount of work
- Deterministic

### Complexity and performance

- Algorithm must return the correct result
- Easy to understand and implement
- Efficient use of time and memory
- Performance

  - Time complexity
  - Space complexity
  - Hardware complexity

  ### Classification of time complexity functions

  - Exponential time complexity
    - E.g. $2^2$
