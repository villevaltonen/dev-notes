## Abstract data structures

- Already implemented solutions are the priority, but sometimes there isn't suitable one
- Suitable (usable, enough efficient):
  - Needed operations
  - Enough efficient
  - Type of the element can be fitted into our needs
  - Created in suitable language
  - Has a applicable software license
- Understanding the implementation helps us to use data structures correctly
- Define abstract data structure with an interface and keep the implementation apart

### Encapsulation and parametritizing

- Interface defines the implementation
- The real implementation can be freely chosen (in ideal cases)

### Implementating set

- If order is needed, then implementation with inordered balanced binary tree
- Otherwise usually a hashmap
