## Merge sort

- Divide and conquer but in different order
- Time complexity O(nlogn)
- Briefly:
  1. Divide the array from the middle
  2. Sort the partitions recursively
  3. Finally merge partitions
- Fastest in mass storage
- Fastest in memory if elements are partially in order
- Works on lists too, because input is iterated in sequential order
- Works on sequential files
